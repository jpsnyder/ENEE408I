Jon:
	- Create ArduinoController interface that sends and receives data
		- send to arduino commands
			- move x distance at y speed
			- turn r radians cw
			- allow for future commands
		- receive from arduino
			- i moved z distance
			- my ping sensors are (l cm, r cm)

Ryan:
	- door detection
	- intial setup of opencv algroithm

Eashan:
	- motor encoders
	- create commands that can handle usb communcation as described in Jon's tasks




Unassigned Tasks:
	- research OpenCV and mapping algorthms
	- figure out how data what should be sent over to android
	- get wheel encoders to work
	- get servos for ping sensors to work
	- iron out driving straight algorithm
